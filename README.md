# System-ID-and-Speed-Control-of-DC-Servo-Motor
**To design a feedback compensator meeting performance specifications for DC Servo Motor model and thus evaluating stability margins** 

#### Objectives Achieved: 

- Constructed a Matlab LTI object using an analytic motor model and parameter values from manufacturers data sheets
- Estimated the open-loop frequency response from experimental time-domain data
- Validated the Matlab model by comparing the time domain and frequency domain responses 
- Designed a feedback compensator to meet time domain and frequency domain performance specifications
- Implement the compensator design as an LTI object
- Evaluate stability margins and performance metrics for your design
